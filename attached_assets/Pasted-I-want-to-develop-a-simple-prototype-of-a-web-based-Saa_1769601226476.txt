I want to develop a simple prototype of a web-based SaaS product app serving as a mobile notebook for business need. This is a web-based business platform.
Overview
A set of low-fidelity prototype for a web application that helps businesses manage sales, customers, bookings, payments, reminders, and analytics. Target users: Administrators, authenticated users (staff), guests (limited access), and clients (business owners who see their unique business data) 
Goals
•	Fast taskboard (home) for daily work
•	Excel-like forms for structured data entry and bulk import/export
•	Payment flows for online orders and integration with chat-based support
•	Timely reminders and offline access (PWA)
•	Simple onboarding and secure authentication flows
Features

1. User & Access Management (Foundation)
This keeps the platform secure and role-aware.
•	Multi-role authentication (Admin, Staff/User, Guest)

2. Business Profile & Client Homepage
This is each client’s “command center.”

Your daily-use feature.

4. Excel-Like Forms & Data Sheets

Very important for reliability.
